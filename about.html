        <h2>About Green Earth Initiative</h2>
        <p>Joined in 2018, Green Earth initiative emerged from a small group of environmental advocates who were passionate about creating tangible change in their community. What started as weekend beach cleanups has grown into a comprehensive environmental organization with >500 active volunteers.</p>
        
        <p>Our mission is simple: to create a sustainable future through direct action, education, and community engagement. We believe that environmental change starts at the grassroots level, with individuals and communities working together to protect our planet.</p>
