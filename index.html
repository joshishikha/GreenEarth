        <h2>Join Our Mission Against Plastic Pollution</h2>
        <p>Every year, over 8 million tons of plastic waste enter our oceans, harming marine life and contaminating our food chain. At Green Earth Initiative, we're committed to reducing plastic pollution through community education, sustainable alternatives, and advocacy for policy change. Together, we can create a world where single-use plastics are a thing of the past and our ecosystems thrive once again.</p>

            <h3>Ocean Cleanup Campaign</h3>
            <p>Our newest initiative focuses on removing plastic debris from coastlines and waterways. Through organized beach cleanups, community partnerships, and educational workshops, we've already removed over 5,000 pounds of plastic waste from our local marine environments. Join us every weekend as we work to restore our oceans to their natural beauty.</p>
